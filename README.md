## About ADTK: 

### What is it?
Anomaly Detection Toolkit (ADTK) is a Python package for unsupervised / rule-based time series anomaly detection.

### Why are we using it? 

"This package offers a set of common detectors, transformers and aggregators with unified APIs, as well as pipe classes that connect them together into a model. It also provides some functions to process and visualize time series and anomaly events." â€” [ADTK Docs](https://adtk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
