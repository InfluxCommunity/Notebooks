# Analyze time series data

Analyze and test your time series data using Jupyter Notebook tutorials (.ipynb files) and corresponding sample data (.csv files). We include tutorials and sample data for the following topics:

- [How to generate time series data](/notebooks/Generate_Time_Series.ipynb)
- [How to get started with InfluxDB and Python](/notebooks/Getting_Started_with_InfluxDB_and_Python.ipynb)

- Anomaly detection:
  - For [multiple time series](/tree/Anomaly_Detection/Multiple%20time%20series), including BIRCH, KMEANS, and MAD.
  - For [single time series](/tree/Anomaly_Detection/Single%20time%20series), including Autoregression, LevelShiftAD, and SeasonalAD

- [Forecasting](/tree/Forecasting), including FBProphet and LSTM
